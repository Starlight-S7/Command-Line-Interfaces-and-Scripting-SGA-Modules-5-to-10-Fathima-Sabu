The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out you grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of the crusaders
Good thing I like my friends cancelled!
I like'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour
And poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld
where it gets quite dark
Atleast you know exactly who your friends are
They are the ones with matching scars.
It is easy to love you when you are popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop you're off the roaster
Tone deaf and hot let's off her
Did you make a joke only a man could
Were you just too smug for your own good?
Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight
Baby, that all ends tonight
